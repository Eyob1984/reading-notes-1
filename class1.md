# Node.js, Test Driven Development and Continuous Integration

1. **Why would you want to run JavaScript code outside of a browser?**
_Running JS outside of a browser allows you to do all sorts of cool backendy things, like access APIs, create and use databases as well as other packages of awesomeness other developers create and make accessible with node.js._

2. **What is the difference between a module and a package?**
_A module is a chunk of code written for a specific purpose within an application while a package is code written by someone else and added as a support of sorts to an application, allowing modules to do cool things._

3. **What is one benefit of Test Driven Development?**
_Developers are forced to write small simple basic bits of code that can be tested and thus inspire more confidence._

4. **What is one potential downside of Test Driven Development?**
_TDD can feel tedious, especially in the beginning of development, as a developer gets used to it as every small bit must be tested and pass before the next bit is written._

5. **What does the node package manager do?**
_Node package manager keeps track of what packages are needed to run your application. THen when your app is used on another computer, the manager makes sure the app has the packages it needs to run properly._
