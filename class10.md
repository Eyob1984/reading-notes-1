# Authentication

**Why is authentication important?**
_Authentication is important because it keeps passwords secure while moving between client and server. _

**Why should we be careful about storing a userâ€™s password?**
_When a user's password is stored, the app is responsible for maintaining the security of that password and thus the data the password is protecting._

**What is the difference between hashing and encryption?**
Encryption works both ways and can be decrypted if a person has the proper key. Hashing is a one way system and can somehow, if properly implemented, never be unhashed. I don't understand how something couldn't be undone, especially if it needs to be accessible at some point. 

**What is the difference between encryption and encoding?**
Encryption is used for security where as encoding is used for maintaining usability of data. 

**What is a token used for?**
A token is used to authenticate things, such as a password. And yes, things is a technical term.
