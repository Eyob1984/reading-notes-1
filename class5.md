# Database Structures and Alg


**What is a data structure?**
_A data structure is simply a way of organizing data so that it can be easily accessed._

**How is a Linked List different from an array?**
_In an array each entry is indexed, where as in a linked list, to get to any node, you must loop over the entire list until you find the node you are looking for._

**What is one benefit a Linked List has over an array?**
_A linked list is more flexible than an array, which can come in handy in older languages where modifying an array takes up time and space in a program. _

**What data does a Node hold in a doubly Linked List?**
_In a doubly linked list a node is linked to the node before it, next, and after, prev, allowing for traversal of the node list to move forward and backward._

**What would you use to implement a Linked List data type? (object, function, class, variableâ€¦?)**
_Using a class and a constructor fucntion, can make creating nodes simple._
