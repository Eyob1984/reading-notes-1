_Object-oriented programing. In JS we call it an interface._

**How does any web browser understand how to open any webpage?**
_The browser uses the URL to make a request to the server holding the code fro that site. The browser then reads the code and interprets what to do with that code by something like the package-lock.json file that has instructions for hte browser._

**Name one thing a request object must have, and one thing a response object must have.**
_Request Object: must have a URL with the path to the information holding the reqested information. 
Response Object: must have an array of object(s)._

**What is the difference between HTTP and REST?**
_HTTP Is the what: hyper text transfer protocol. In order for data to transfer between client and server, the HTTP rules must be followed. REST is more of the agreed upon how: Representational State Transfer. REST says, this is how we are going to format our data to meet HTTP requirements.  _

**Why is REST important?**
_REST is important because while we need to follow rules to transfer data, have a general set of agreed upon frameworks for that data, makes traversing and handling that data easier. A standardization that simplifies life._
