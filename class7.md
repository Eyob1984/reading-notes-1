# Express

**What code does the server actually run?**
I'm not entirely sure what this question is asking. The server runs the code we write and tell it to run... Does it not? 

**What Express/HTTP operations map to CRUD operations?**
Create - post
Read - get
Update - put
Delete - delete


**What does res.send() do?**
Send results to the route indicated 

**What is the order of operations for the three categories of middleware (handler, application, route)?**
Application runs when it is open. The handler runs when it is called when a specific route is used.


**What is the parameter next used for?**
It will call the next block of code in the function.
