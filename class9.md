# More things to do with the DB and middleware 

- **Describe a use-case where param middleware would come in handy.**
Param middleware can be useful for validating the request param before moving on to the route. 

- **What are the two ways to add middleware in-between Mongoose and MongoDB interactions?**
Prehook and posthooks

- **What is the difference between a join by reference and a virtual join?**
I'm not super clear on this but I think a reference allows for a reference between two objects while a virtual join stores the key rather than the object. 

- **What do localField and foreignField mean?**
I'm not entirely sure what these are, but I think the localField is part of a smaller object that references a larger object.
