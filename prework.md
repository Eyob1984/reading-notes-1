### How to solve programing problems:

[Reference](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)

**Read the problem completely twice**
	- Make sure you understand the problem completely. Can you explain it to someone else?
**Solve the problem womanually with three steps of sample data**
	- Write out what needs to be done and why, each step, without code.
**Optimize the manual steps**
	- Where can we write out loops or other ways to automate the steps we wrote out above?
**Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code**
	- Start to use coding language to begin to code out the manual steps.
**Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code**
	- Write actual code.
**Optimize the real code**
	- Automate where you can if you haven’t yet. 

_**Roughly 70% of time should be in steps 1-3**_


### Act like you make $1000 an hour:

One must know what their priorities are in order to make good decisions on what to say yes to and what to say no to .then value their time enough to respect those values and truly say no to tasks that are business tasks, whether self inflicted or asked to do by others. 

### How to think like a programer - lessons in problem solving:

[Reference](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2/)

1. Understand. Know exactly what is being asked. If you can’t explain it in simple terms, you most likely don’t understand what is being asked. 
2. Plan. Write down the exact steps that need to be taken, how they all work out together. 
3. Divide. Break the problem domain into small testable size pieces. Make them work and put them together. 
4. Stuck. Be curious rather than frustrated. Debug. Reassess. Research. 
5. Practice. Practice this problem solving technique outside of programming. Playing games, Etc. 

### The Five Whys and Hows:

[Reference](http://asq.org/healthcare-use/why-quality/five-whys.html)

When trying to drill down as to why a problem is presenting itself and how to fix it, asking WHy at least five times and How to fix it, at least five times, can help one drill down to the root cause / causes, and solution / solutions on how to fix it.
